//Todo:

/////Engine:
//Model loading
//GLM make vec's and mat's conversion to string
//Transform support rotations

/////RayTracer
//Implement multithreading
//give each ray a random offset, add the samples together to get anti aliasing
//Raytracer: calculate soft shadows by using a light area, take a random sample to one point of this light, and add the samples together
//Refactor materials. Make materials data only and put calculates somewhere else.
//sqrtf the results to make add gamma correction
//Fix BVH
//use simd to calculate 4 rays at once.
//Make MaterialOld a resource
//Divide the raytracer into grids

/////Raytracer:
//Debug radiance
//Split screen in 2 for debugging
//Stratification
//Blue noise
//Filtering
//Path Guiding


//to generate a bvh, use throw all the triangles of all the models in a big array with each triangle to a pointer to the material
//check dirty for transforms to only recalculate a part of an BVH
//refitting a BVH : resize the bounding boxes to match they children objects / leaves. (only works if the amount of objects are the same)

//Update Muse.h
